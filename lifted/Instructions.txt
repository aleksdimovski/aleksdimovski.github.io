# Installation

The tool requires the following applications and libraries:

* OCaml 

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install ocaml-interp
	```

* Findlib

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install ocaml-findlib
	```

* Menhir: LR(1) parser generator

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install menhir
	```
  
* Opam: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install opam
	```
  
* OUnit

	```
	opam install ounit
	```

* APRON: numerical abstract domain library

	```
	opam install apron
	```

* Zarith: arbitrary-precision integer operations

	```
	opam install zarith
	```


# Compiling FuncTion

Once all required libraries are installed, FuncTion can be compiled with 'make':

```
make
```

This will generate the command line program 'function' in the project directory. 

Alternatively, 'ocamlbuild' can be used to build FuncTion with the following command:

```
ocamlbuild ml_float.o Main.native -use-ocamlfind -use-menhir -pkgs 'apron,gmp,oUnit,zarith' -I utils -I banal -I domains -I frontend -I cfgfrontend -I main -libs boxMPQ,octD,polkaMPQ,str,zarith -lflags banal/ml_float.o
```

# Usage

// /home/aleks/.opam/system/share/apron/lib/libpolkaMPQ.so

The command-line analyzer can be invoked using the following call pattern:

	./my_function <file> <analysis> [options] 

where "file" is the path to the C file to be analyzed and "analysis" the type of the analysis to perform. 

The analyzer performs a forward reachability analysis of programs with #ifdef-s.

The following general command-line options are recognized
(showing their default value):

	 -single 							set to perform single-program analysis
	 -tuple								set to perform tuple-based lifted analysis
	 -bdd								set to perform bdd-based lifted analysis
	 -main main                         set the analyzer entry point (defaults to main)
	 -domain boxes|octagons|polyhedra   set the abstract domain (defaults to boxes)
	 -joinfwd 2                         set the widening delay in forward analysis

# Examples

enter the folder that contains the tool, and write

$ ./Main.native -tuple -domain polyhedra mytests/loop-invgen/heapsort.c

to perform tuple-based lifted analysis using Polyhedra domain of the heapsort.c file in the folder mytests/loop-invgen

$ ./Main.native -bdd -domain boxes mytests/loop-invgen/heapsort.c

to perform BDD-based lifted analysis using Intervals domain of the heapsort.c file in the folder mytests/loop-invgen
